# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|

| Site: www.indeed.com | Score:  8/10| Summary: Immediately, Indeed asks the user what job they are looking for and where they wish to work. When a user enters the field they wish to work in and where they want to work, Indeed asks if they wish to add their resume and allows the user to choose an area of work based on what they enter. Additionally, if Indeed cannot find your specific area of work, they find similar jobs to it. It's quick, easy, and gives the user everything they want out of a job search site.|

| ------ | ------- | --------- |

| Site: www.ziprecruiter.com | Score: 5/10| Summary: Ziprecruiter opens to a person named Phil. Phil is an AI personal recruiter that a user can talk to with pre-determined answers. If you don't wish to work with Phil, you can scroll down and type in your area of work and where. Right away, after you press enter, your asked to put in your email to search jobs. This means that you NEED to have an account first. After you type in your email, you need to create an account, and then it send you right back to job search. Overall, Ziprecruiter can be very annoying since it makes users take extra steps in order to do what they wish. |
